1️⃣ Binary → Decimal
binary = "1010"
decimal = int(binary, 2)
print(decimal)   # Output: 10

2️⃣ Decimal → Binary
decimal = 10
binary = bin(decimal)[2:]
print(binary)    # Output: 1010

3️⃣ Binary → Octal
binary = "1010"
octal = oct(int(binary, 2))[2:]
print(octal)     # Output: 12

4️⃣ Octal → Binary
octal = "12"
binary = bin(int(octal, 8))[2:]
print(binary)    # Output: 1010
